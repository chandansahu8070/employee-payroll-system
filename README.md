Employee Payroll System
ðŸ“– Project Overview

The Employee Payroll System is a Java-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project designed to handle employee information, salary calculations, and payroll management in an organization.

It demonstrates the use of core OOP principles:

Encapsulation â†’ Employee details are stored in private fields with getters and setters.

Inheritance â†’ Different employee types (Full-time, Part-time, Contract) can extend a base Employee class.

Polymorphism â†’ Different salary calculation methods depending on employee type.

Abstraction â†’ Abstract classes/interfaces for payroll processing.

This project is ideal for beginners to intermediate developers learning OOP concepts, as well as for interview preparation.
